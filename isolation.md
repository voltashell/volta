> can you explain to me how much access and isolation each agent will have from one another

⏺ Great question! Let me break down the isolation and access levels for each agent:

  Current Isolation Levels:

  VM-Level Isolation (Docker Desktop):

  - All containers run inside Docker Desktop's Linux VM
  - VM is isolated from your macOS host system
  - Containers share the VM's kernel but are isolated from each other

  Container-Level Isolation:

  Each agent container has:
  - Separate filesystem (read-only root, private /tmp and /run)
  - Separate process namespace (can't see other containers' processes)
  - Separate network namespace (isolated networking)
  - Resource limits (CPU/memory constraints)
  - Dropped capabilities (cap_drop: ALL - no privileged operations)
  - No new privileges (no-new-privileges:true)

  What Each Agent CAN Access:

  1. Shared Storage:
  /shared/agents/agent-1/  # Agent 1's private directory
  /shared/agents/agent-2/  # Agent 2's private directory
  /shared/agents/agent-3/  # Agent 3's private directory
  /shared/common/          # Shared read-write area
  /shared/logs/           # Shared logging directory
  2. NATS Messaging:
    - All agents can publish/subscribe to NATS topics
    - Communication is message-based, not direct access
  3. Network:
    - Custom Docker bridge network ai-flock_bus
    - Can communicate with NATS server
    - Cannot directly access each other's containers

  What Each Agent CANNOT Access:

  1. Other Agent's Processes:
    - Cannot see or interact with processes in other containers
    - Cannot kill or modify other agents
  2. Host System:
    - No access to macOS host filesystem
    - No access to host processes
    - No access to Docker socket (except monitor container)
  3. Other Agent's Private Data:
    - Cannot read /shared/agents/agent-X/ directories of other agents
    - Each has write access only to their own directory
  4. System-Level Operations:
    - Cannot install software
    - Cannot modify system configuration
    - Cannot access hardware directly

  │  │    │ /shared/agents/*/    │        │       │
  │  │    └─────────────────────┘        │       │
  │  └────────────────────────────────────┘       │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Real-World Implications:

  High Isolation:
  - Agent 1 cannot directly hack or compromise Agent 2
  - Container escape would still be contained within the VM
  - Process-level isolation prevents interference

  Controlled Communication:
  - Agents can only communicate via NATS messages
  - All communication is logged and auditable
  - No direct filesystem or network access between agents

  Shared Resources:
  - Agents can coordinate via shared storage
  - Common data exchange through /shared/common/
  - But each has private workspace

  This is production-grade isolation suitable for running untrusted or experimental AI agents safely.

> are these agents working in parallel?

⏺ Yes! The agents are working in true parallel. Let me show you exactly how:

  Parallel Execution Architecture:

  Physical Parallelism:

  - 3 separate Docker containers running simultaneously
  - 3 separate Node.js processes (one per container)
  - 3 separate CPU allocations (can use multiple cores)
  - Independent memory spaces for each agent

  Concurrent Task Processing:

  Each agent runs this loop simultaneously:

  // All 3 agents run this concurrently
  (async () => {
    for await (const msg of taskSub) {
      try {
        const result = await processTask(msg.data, agentDir);
        // Each agent processes tasks independently
        nc.publish('task.result', sc.encode(JSON.stringify(result)));
      } catch (err) {
        // Handle errors independently
      }
    }
  })()

  NATS Message Distribution:

  When tasks are published to tasks.*:
  - All 3 agents receive the message simultaneously
  - Each processes it independently
  - Results come back in parallel
