Plan: Implementing a Filesystem Task Queue
This plan outlines how to coordinate multiple Docker containers working on a shared set of tasks without them interfering with each other. It relies on atomic filesystem move operations to ensure each task is processed by exactly one agent.

Step 1: Create the Directory Structure
On your shared filesystem volume, create the following directories. This structure will act as the "state machine" for your tasks.

Bash

/path/to/shared/volume/
├── todo/
├── processing/
├── done/
└── failed/
todo: New tasks are placed here. This is the starting point for all work.

processing: When an agent claims a task, it moves the file here. This directory shows what's currently being worked on.

done: Successfully completed tasks are moved here by the agents.

failed: If an agent fails to process a task, it moves the original task file here for inspection.

Step 2: Define the Task File Format
Your task files should contain all the information an agent needs to do its job. JSON is an excellent format for this.

Example task_123.json:

JSON

{
  "taskId": "123-abc-789",
  "inputFile": "/path/to/shared/volume/data/source_image.png",
  "outputFile": "/path/to/shared/volume/results/processed_image.png",
  "operation": "sharpen",
  "parameters": {
    "amount": 0.85,
    "radius": 1.5
  }
}
Step 3: Implement the Agent's Core Logic
This is the most critical part. Each of your AI agents will run a loop with the following logic.

Pseudocode for an agent:

Python

# A unique ID for this agent, e.g., the container hostname
AGENT_ID = get_my_unique_id() 
TODO_DIR = "/path/to/shared/volume/todo/"
PROCESSING_DIR = "/path/to/shared/volume/processing/"
DONE_DIR = "/path/to/shared/volume/done/"
FAILED_DIR = "/path/to/shared/volume/failed/"

while True:
    # 1. Find a task
    tasks = list_files(TODO_DIR)
    if not tasks:
        sleep(5) # Wait if no tasks are available
        continue

    task_file_name = tasks[0]
    source_path = TODO_DIR + task_file_name
    
    # 2. Try to claim the task atomically
    claimed_path = PROCESSING_DIR + AGENT_ID + "_" + task_file_name
    try:
        # This is the key atomic operation
        move_file(source_path, claimed_path) 
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Another agent grabbed it first. No problem.
        continue 

    # 3. Process the task
    try:
        task_data = read_json(claimed_path)
        
        # --- DO YOUR AI WORK HERE ---
        result = perform_ai_operation(task_data)
        # --- END OF AI WORK ---
        
        # 4. Mark task as done
        # Optionally, write results summary to a new file in 'done'
        write_result_summary(DONE_DIR, result)
        # Move the original task file to 'done' to signify completion
        move_file(claimed_path, DONE_DIR + task_file_name)

    except Exception as e:
        # 5. Handle failure
        log_error(e)
        # Move the task file to the 'failed' directory
        move_file(claimed_path, FAILED_DIR + task_file_name)
Step 4: Create a Task Dispatcher
You need a way to add new jobs to the queue. This can be a simple script or a manual process. All it needs to do is create a task file (like the JSON above) and place it in the /todo directory.

Step 5: Implement a Janitor/Monitoring Script (Optional but Recommended)
This is a separate, simple process that handles cleanup. It prevents the system from getting stuck if an agent crashes.

Janitor Logic:

Scan the /processing directory for "stale" files (e.g., files that haven't been modified in a long time, say 30 minutes).

For any stale file found, move it back to the /todo directory.

This allows another agent to pick up the task and try again.

Step 6: Configure Docker Compose
Use a docker-compose.yml file to manage your agents and the shared volume.

Example docker-compose.yml:

YAML

version: '3.8'

services:
  agent-1:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - shared-data:/app/shared
    environment:
      - AGENT_ID=agent-1

  agent-2:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - shared-data:/app/shared
    environment:
      - AGENT_ID=agent-2

  agent-3:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - shared-data:/app/shared
    environment:
      - AGENT_ID=agent-3

volumes:
  shared-data:
    driver: local # Or a network driver if on a cluster
This setup ensures all agent containers share the same shared-data volume where your todo, processing, etc., directories live.
